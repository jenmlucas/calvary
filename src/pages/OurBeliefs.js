      <p>
        Calvary Chapel has been formed as a fellowship of believers in the
        Lordship of Jesus Christ. Our desire is to know Christ and to be
        conformed to His image by the Power of the Holy Spirit. We are not a
        denominational church but do not oppose denominations as such, only the
        over-emphasis of the doctrinal differences that have lead to the
        division and the watered-down beliefs of the Body of Christ. WE BELIEVE
        that the only true basis of Christian fellowship is the Love of Christ,
        which is greater than any differences we have, and without His Love, we
        have no right to claim ourselves as Christians. WE BELIEVE worship of
        God should be Spiritual. WE BELIEVE worship of God should be
        Inspirational. WE BELIEVE worship of God should be Intelligent. WE
        BELIEVE worship of God is Fruitful.
